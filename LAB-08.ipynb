    "\n",
    "* so we can have a check function which checks if some player has already won the game \n",
    "* we can alternate the chances between the players via % and till some player wins the game or all cells get filled \n",
    "* we can take input from the user about which symbol he wants to pick \n",
    "* we can have a toss between the player to decide which player would start \n",
    "* we can have a simple case as well where we denote that 2nd player is 'O' and first player is 'X'\n",

    "**so basically the flow will go like this**\n",

    "1. create a empty 2D array whose initial values are all 'Y' characters lets say\n",
    "2. create the toss between the 2 players using rand function (ex. toss = rand()%2==0?player1:player2)\n",
    "3. start playing based on the player that wins toss\n",
    "4. check after playing each move whether the player who just moved won the game \n",
    "    4.1 If he wins the game then output the player which won that game and then end game \n",
    "    4.2 If not then continue the game giving 2nd player chance to play\n",
    "5. when 2nd player chooses a square lets say 2,0 then first check if (2,0) is already filled with X/O \n",
    "    5.1 if yes then output wrong input X/O already exists in that square \n",
